ABSTRACT

The main purpose of developing this web application is to help companies to be able to track visitors that are coming in and going out of their building per day. Most companies they use hard copy form to capture details of their visitor, before allowing them to access the building.
The Data master application will solve this kind of problem of filling hard copy form by registering a visitor’s details in the system using the tablet device of a company. The system can keep the details of the visitor in the system’s database to avoid visitors to register more than once.

INTRODUCTION 

Data Master Application is a responsive web application developed for the companies to track visitors entering their building. The visitors will have to register her/his details in the system using company’s electronic device. The technologies used in this system are MYSQL Database and the programming languages used is JavaScript and PHP. This system is for transforming the current long process system of filling hard copy form used to register visitors before they enter the building of any company.
 The visitor register his/her details once in the system.  In the system there is an admin part where the admin can view the number of visitors that visit its company.
  The admin as well will have to have a profile to view all the visitors in the system. The application will help the visitors to be able to visit any company using it.  
 
PROBLEM

Many companies they use hard copy forms to register the details of their daily visitors before they allow them to enter their building. The main disadvantage about these forms is that even if a person visited yesterday, the next day that visitor comes back is required to register her details again in the new form again.

SOLUTION

The problem we have encountered needs a solution that is innovative and flexible. We decided to develop a web application that will help companies to track visitors that need to enter into the company’s building. Our system can enable the company to be able to register/sign in its visitors using this system when tracking visitors that are entering its building.

 This system is time saving, since a visitor register once on it. Then the next time a visitor come back again to visit, it can just sign in, instead of registering his/her details again. 
 
PROJECT AIM AND OBJECTIVES

Aim 
We created this web application in the aim of assisting companies from upgrading their system of using hard copy forms when they register their visitors before allowing them to enter their building.
Objectives 
To create Data Master Application that will manage appointments of a visitor and a company.
To provide company and visitors a platform to manage their meetings.  
The application should be able to collect and save all the visitor’s details.

DESIGN CONSTRAINTS AND ASSUMPTIONS:
Constraints for the user
The interface will be in English only.
The system does not cater to users who have disabilities e.g., text to speech for people who have eyesight problems. 
The system is a single-user system.

Constraints for the developer
The developer must understand how to use any source code editor.
It must understand JavaScript, PHP, HTML and CSS3.
It must understand one of the operating system
It must understand how to make the app fit in all screen sizes.

Assumptions
Users must have basic knowledge of navigating through the systems.
The user must have basic knowledge of English.
Users must have internet access on their computers that they use.
	
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

System Hardware Architecture	
Mobile device and Desktop - These devices will enable our system to run in both mobile as for the visitors who will register or sign in, in the system, and desktop for admin for viewing registered users. 
 
Database server – These are the servers that we will use to deploy our database also host and maintain it.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT AND NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

After analysing the data, we formulated several requirements namely user requirements, system hardware and software attributes. These were grouped as user, functional, non-functional and runtime interface requirements.
 
Functional and Non-functional Requirements	

The requirement specifications
Requirement specification describes what the system must do to meet conditions for tracking visitors before they enter any company’s building. It must have functional requirements, basic behaviours of the system, and non-functional requirements which determine all the attributes of the app.
Functional requirements of the app
The visitor’s interaction
The app allow visitors to create their profile on the company’s mobile device.
The app allow visitors to retrieve on it.
The application allow visitors to fill a form for visiting.
The app allow each visitor to view his/her details.
The app allow a visitor to sign out in the system.

The Admin interaction
The app allow an admin to create a profile.
The admin can be able to log in.
The admin is able to view all the registered visitors.
The system can allow the main admin to add other admin.
The system can allow admin to view the history of the visitors.
The admin can view the current log in visitors.
The admin can view signed out visitors
The app allow the admin to be able to search for any visitor.
Non-functional requirements
Non-functional requirement includes the following: 
The system must verify the validated user input and the user must be notified in case of errors detected in the database, the system should allow room for expansion. 
Usability
This app will run on all screen sizes for all mobile devices and desktop computer.
This app will work on any operating system.
Reliability
This app will perform specified functions without crashing as we check exceptions and log them.
Maintainability
We will be able to update the app without losing any data.
Performance
The app will work accurately and effectively.
The app will load faster and smoothly as we catch the data.
Security and availability
The user’s sensitive data will be encrypted and protected.
The app will be available online 24/7.

 USE CASE DIAGRAM

The following is the use case diagram which describes all the attributes of the application.

USER INTERFACE
Inputs
One of the popular input media used by our system to retrieve data for the user is the mobile touch screen keyboard input and Desktop keyboard, mouse and touchpad media which will be used by visitors and Admin to type in data into our system.  

Interface  

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM 

This is the page that displays contacts of the visitors that were visited certain company.  

POPIA 

As our system will flow online where it can be reached by the public. We will make sure that sensitive information of the users like password will be encrypted. We will make sure that when the user is signing in the system. The user will receive an email or an SMS that tells if he/she is the real user or not.

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM 

This is the diagram that shows the decomposition of the system

DEPLOYEMENT DIAGRAM 

This is the diagram that determine our system’s implementation stage

SUMMARY 

I and my team, we developed a very innovative system that will make it easier for the companies to allow visitors that they need to visit their companies. Our system is able to register and sign in visitors electronically to the company they visited before they enter the building.

This system will also help anyone who needed to visit any company for some important needs. This system is important and it could be a valuable asset. Since the company will use a mobile device to sign in visitors instead of using hard copy forms.  

 This application can save time and other physical resources that a company can use to track visitors in and out of the company’s building. Since the system is a computer based system that can work on any kind of computer that a company can afford as long the computer can access the internet.

CONCLUSION

The core reason for the establishment of Data Master is to enable companies to be able to track visitors that need to enter their company’s building. The Web app will enhance the visitors' experience by offering them a most convenient way of consulting and engaging with the companies. This app has successful met all the requirements of visitors and the company.
